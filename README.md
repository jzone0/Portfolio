# My corpus will be on John Mayer, specifically his albums. I am an avid listener and quite a fan of John Mayer so studying and analyzing his music would of course be an interesting topic for me. With eight studio albums, John Mayer has a well-rounded discography that arguably spans across many different genres such as blues, pop, folk, and country. These albums will be the focus of comparison for this project as each one is based in a different genre. 
# The objective will essentially aim to identify how well each of John Mayer's albums adhere to their respective genres. An important consideration to note is that John Mayer obviously did not produce each album with the intent of sticking to a single genre. The aim therefore is to see if and how well each album adheres to a respective genre. In addition to this, an analysis will be made on Spotify's "John Mayer Radio" playlist as it is a representation of what Spotify considers to be similiar to John Mayer's music.
